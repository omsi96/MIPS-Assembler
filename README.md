# MIPS-Assembler

This project will help you convert your MIPS assembly code into binary. 
This is a Swift code, it needs you to have a mac, and Xcode to exxcute this. 
You can run this if you have swift installed on Ubuntu, but believe me totally not worth it

# how this works? 
1. Open the Xcode project using Xcode.
2. run the app. 
3. It will show 2 options, either your live code, or you read from a file 
3.a if you want to read from a file, go to `intructions.swift` and write all your MIPS code there. Make sure your commands in this format `add r1, r3, r5`, you can use `r` or `$`, preferbally r.
